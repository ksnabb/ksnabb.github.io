the definition of currying. Nevertheless I will collect different curry methods in this page.</p><h2>Variadic Arity Currying</h2><p>This version of the curry function works with any function arity.
The returned curried function will take as many parameters as is passed into it at a time.
</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/ksnabb/f33097771bd371397e21f86b3cdac599.js"></script><p>One of the bad sides of this curry method is that it will not give any warning if it's called with too many arguments. 
Another is that the returned function will have a set arity of 0 which is not correct. 
The set arity of 0 might make some composition or other type of functional combination of functions impossible or difficult with the returned function.
</p><p>The good being the implementation is simple and flexible.</p><h2>Fixed Arity Currying</h2><p>TODO, this type of currying is done in e.g. ramda</p><script src="/js/notes/curry-with-javascript.js"></script></body></html>
