</p><p>More formally a composition is when we have a function <em>f</em>
that takes an argument of type <em>A</em> and returns <em>B</em>
<em>(A &rarr; B)</em> and another function <em>g</em> that takes
an argument of type <em>B</em> and returns <em>C</em>
<em>(B &rarr; C)</em>. Then we can create a function out of
<em>f</em> and <em>g</em> that takes an argument of type
<em>A</em> and returns <em>C</em> <em>(A &rarr; C)</em>.
</p><p>This type of function composition can be denoted as
<em>f &compfn; g</em>.
</p><p>Below is an implementation of a compose function in JavaScript (note! the functions are applied in a left to right order).</p><script src="//gist.github.com/ksnabb/a023f3643c50cfdc6d272a0e738d1106.js?file=composition-with-javascript.js"></script><h2>Composing multiple functions</h2><p>In practice a more useful compose function would allow you to compose a variadic amount of functions at the same
time.
</p><p>When composing multiple functions it's good to realise that function composition is always associative.
Which means that <em>f &compfn; (g &compfn; h)</em> gives the same result as <em>(f &compfn; g) &compfn; h</em>.
