  h1 Testing the Simple Counter

  p This setup tests the Simple Counter app.

  p.
    The test framework used is #[a(href="https://mochajs.org/") mocha] which provides a way to run
    tests in the browser. The component itself is included in the server side templates on this page.

  p.
    Below you can see the same simple counter component that was presented in the #[a(href="/notes/simple-counter.html") Simple Counter] note.

  include ../components/simple-counter.pug

  p.
    The testing is done by checking with the help of DOM functions the state of the simple counter and also
    triggering click event on the simple counter button.

  p The tests them selves are run when loading this page and the result can be seen below:

  #mocha

  script mocha.setup('bdd')

  script(src="/js/notes/simple-counter-app-test.js")
