h1 The Framework

p.
  I have noticed a repetitive pattern in the "React examples" I've created without using React or any other
  framework. To reduce boilerplate and repetition I'm combining the pubsub.js and the state.js into something
  that i will call "The framework".

p Below you can see one pure JavaScript impementation of publish subscribe.

h2 The State

p The state will use the above pubSub to dispatch events on state changes.
